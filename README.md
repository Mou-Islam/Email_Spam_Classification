# Email_Spam_Classification
In this project we will try to develop algorithms or models that can automatically identify and classify incoming emails as either spam or non-spam.
To provide users with a more efficient and secure email experience by reducing the volume of spam and ensuring that important
messages are not mistakenly identified as spam thus reducing the amount of unwanted or malicious content that users have to deal with.
Our motivation,
By classifying emails as spam or non spam, email providers and users can effectively manage their email
communications, prioritize important messages, and protect themselves from potential phishing attempts, scams, or
malware that may be contained within spam emails...
